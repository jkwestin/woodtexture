Procedural wood texture

This is a small flash application that generates wood textures using perlin noise. The program is written in Haxe using <a href="https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel" target="_blank">Haxeflixel</a>. The algorithm for creating wood textures is loosely based on the AS3 WoodTexture class at <a href="http://www.flashandmath.com/flashcs5/wood/" target="_blank">flashandmath.com</a>. The images are encoded to png using <a href="https://github.com/cameron314/PNGEncoder2" target="_blank">PNGEncoder2</a> library.
